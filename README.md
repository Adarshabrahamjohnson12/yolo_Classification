# üîç YOLO Classification Project

**A computer vision project using YOLOv8 for image classification ‚Äî trained with Roboflow and deployed with a custom Python pipeline.**

---

## üì∏ What is this?

This project uses the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** deep learning model to classify objects in images.  
It was trained using **Roboflow** for dataset preparation and annotation, and the final model is saved as `best.pt`.

Possible use cases:
- Detecting product defects  
- Classifying plant species  
- Sorting objects in real-time with a webcam  
- Any other custom image classification task
